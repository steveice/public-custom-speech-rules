# Public Custom Speech Rules

This is a place where developers from teh Jibo community can download and collaborate on custom speech rules.

We've initially started with the YesNo.rule which is an extension from the factory rule as [suggested by DevMiser](https://discuss.jibo.com/t/whilecondition-decorator-question/1425/8)
